    // is a separate type in C++ to represent amounts of memory.
    // C++ uses a separate type size_t because the existing types
    // are defined based on the target processorâ€™s arithmetic
    // capabilities, not the memory capabilities. The size_t is
    // unsigned defined in the stddef.h header file. The maximum
    // value of the size_t is defined as a macro constant ( SIZE_MAX)
    // in the cstdint file. It is at least 65535.
